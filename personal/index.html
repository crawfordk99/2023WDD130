    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>   I am from Waukegan IL, about a hour straight north of Chicago. Both of
       of my parents are from Belize, although my ancestry is from all over Central America
       and Europe. I have 2 younger sisters. I served in Tucson AZ (17 months) and 
       Vancouver CA (6 months) because of Covid. I'm majoring in Computer Science.
       I love to play basketball, read/watch/play any good story in any medium, 
       write poetry, and hangout with my family/friends doing anything in my free time.
    </p>   
    <p>   I'm just trying to learn all the different fields of computer work so 
       I can see which career would interest me most, and leave some flexibility
       for a field change in the future depending on what new technology is 
       developed/in demand. My favorite scripture is Alma 37:6-7 currently. 
       "By small and simple things are great things brought to pass..." has kind 
       of become my motto for studying and trying to build up my skills for a 
       career, and I think it applies perfectly to programming/software/web development.
    </p>
